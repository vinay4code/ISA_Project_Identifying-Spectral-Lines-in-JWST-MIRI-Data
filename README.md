# Identifying Spectral Lines in JWST MIRI Data

## 📘 Overview
This project extracts and analyzes mid-infrared spectra from JWST MIRI data for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469. It demonstrates spectral feature extraction using Python and identifies key emission lines from different regions of the galaxy.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Astropy, SpectralCube, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- SAOImage DS9 (for region selection)
- LaTeX for report writing
- JWST MIRI MAST data

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the notebook in `notebooks/`

## 📌 Results
- Extracted spectra from AGN core and star-forming ring
- Identified 10+ emission lines (PAHs, [Ne II], [O IV], etc.)
- Full report available in `report/report.pdf`
